# This file makes 'models' a Python package.
# You can also optionally expose models here for easier import, e.g.:
# from .compute import CanonicalCompute
# from .network import CanonicalNetwork, CanonicalNetworkInterface
# from .storage import CanonicalStorage

# For now, we'll keep it simple and let users import directly from the modules.
